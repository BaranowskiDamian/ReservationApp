# ReservationApp
THIS APP ALLOWS CHOOSING DATES FOR A RENTAL PERIOD AND CALCULATES THE PRICE ACCORDING TO PREDEFINED PRICES IN A DATABASE.
THE PRICE GIVEN IS THE TOTAL PRICE, BUT ON A REQUEST IT SHOWS THE SPREAD WITH A SUMMARY PRICE FOR EACH “SEASON” THE CHOSEN PERIOD INCLUDES
AND THE AMOUNT OF DAYS IT CONTAINS (DIFFERENT PRICES IN DIFFERENT “SEASONS”).

THE APP CHECKS THE CHOSEN PERIOD WITH ALREADY CONFIRMED (SAVED) RENTAL TIMES FOR COLLISIONS AND GIVES A FEEDBACK IF IT OCCURS.

TABLES IN THE DATABASE ARE:

CREATE TABLE COST_PER_DAY (
ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
SEASONNAME VARCHAR(25),
BEGIN_DATE DATE,
END_DATE DATE,
COST INT);

CREATE TABLE RESERVATIONS (
ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(15),
LASTNAME VARCHAR(15),
EMAILADRESS VARCHAR(50),
TELEPHONENUMBER INT,
BEGINDATE DATE,
ENDDATE DATE,
COST INT);
